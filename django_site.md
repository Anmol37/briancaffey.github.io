Here's another site I have working on to learn Django and the Django REST framework.

[briancaffey.com](http://briancaffey.com)

This site is built with Django 1.10.5, Bootstrap 3, Python 3.5 and I deployed it on Heroku. In the near future I am planning on putting together a tutorial on how to quickly build and deploy a simple website with Django.
