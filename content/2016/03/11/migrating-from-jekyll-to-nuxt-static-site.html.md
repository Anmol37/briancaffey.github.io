As a long-time WordPress user, I have decided try hosting my personal website with [GitHub Pages][github-pages] and [Jekyll][jekyll-site].

While it has taken some getting used to Jekyll, I've enjoyed the process of learning how to get things set up and running. I'll have to write up a post at some point to aggregate the guides and examples I have followed to make this site possible.

[jekyll-site]: https://jekyllrb.com/
[github-pages]: https://pages.github.com/
